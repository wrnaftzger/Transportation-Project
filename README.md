# Transportation-Project

Hosted by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub & National Student Data Corps, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.

The goal of this project was to provide valuable insights to the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, in hopes of making New York roads a safer place for drivers and pedestrians.

## Conclusions
Conclusion

1. Population
Based on the imformation above, population is the largest predictor of crashes. This is due to a couple reasons:

More people means more cars on the road, leading to more congested roadways and traffic

There is a larger population of pedestrians and cyclists, contributing to factors that cause collisons.

Larger populations also have more maintence and complexitiy in their transportation infustructure, which can make navigting it more difficult, but also making sure everything is up to date and working more difficult.

2. Employment Rate
Employment directly contributes to crashes simply because of commuting:

Higher employment rates mean more people are not only commuting and using the roads, but at the same high traffic times (rush hour).

High employment means there is much more diversity in the ways people get to work (driving, train, walking, etc.) all these different forms of transportation have to coexist and work, which can be a complicated task.

3. Median Income
For income we know as education decreases the amount of crashes increase.

People with greater income are more likely to live in wealthier neighborhoods/boroughs. Because of this the road conditions are more likely to be well kept and up to date.

Wealthier communities are also more likely to to have more options for transportation that are well conntected with the city.

Wealthier drivers are more likely to own newer and safer vechiles with the new top of the line driving features.

Education Levels
Education does not seem to have a direct correlation with crashes, but it indirectly affects other factors.

Education has a strong correlation with employment as well as income. We know from out data income has a negatice correlation and employmeny has a positive correlation with crashes. The correlation is slightly stronger for employment, which would explain this small positive correlation with crashes.
